# Creating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using OpenSSL

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr
```

# Merge Certificate and Private Key to a PKCS#12(PFX) file
## Using OpenSSL
```bash
pkcs12 –export –in certfile.cer –inkey certfile.key –out certfile.pfx
```

## Using CertUtil
```cmd
certutil –MergePFX certfile.cer certfile.pfx
```
Since there is no way to specify private key file for –MergePFX parameter you must consider the following requirements:

- Private key file MUST have .KEY extension;
- certificate and private key files MUST have the same base file name (file name excluding extension);
- certificate and private key file must be placed in the same directory.
